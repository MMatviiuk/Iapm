fix: resolve HTTP 404 error loading complete-database.json

Critical fix for database loading in both development and production environments.

Changes:
- Updated /data/database.ts to use dynamic imports (dev) and fetch (prod)
- Added copyDatabasePlugin to /vite.config.ts for automatic file copying
- Added JSON module type declarations to /vite-env.d.ts
- Added prepare-db script to /package.json for manual database copying
- Added assetsInclude configuration for JSON files in Vite

Technical Details:
- Development: Uses dynamic import() which works with Vite module system
- Production: Fetches from /data/complete-database.json (auto-copied to public/)
- Caching: Database loaded once and cached in memory for performance
- No breaking changes: Backward compatible with existing code

Testing:
- ✅ Development mode: npm run dev → database loads successfully
- ✅ Production build: npm run build → database copied automatically
- ✅ All dashboards work: Patient, Caregiver, Doctor
- ✅ Data integrity: 15 patients, 5 doctors, 5 caregivers
