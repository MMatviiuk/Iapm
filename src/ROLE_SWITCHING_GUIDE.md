## Registration & First-Time Setup

### Choosing Your Initial Role

During registration, you'll see three large cards:

**Patient Card** (Blue):
- "For managing my own medications"
- Includes fields for Date of Birth and Gender
- These help generate a personalized avatar

**Caregiver Card** (Orange):
- "I care for family or friends"
- No DOB/gender needed initially

**Healthcare Professional Card** (Purple):
- "I'm a doctor or healthcare provider"
- Professional interface with patient management

**Note**: You can switch roles anytime after registration, so don't worry about choosing "wrong"!

## Use Cases

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I have multiple roles at once?**
A: Yes! One account can use all three roles. Just switch between them as needed.

**Q: Do I need to set up each role separately?**
A: Yes. Each role has its own data:
- Patient: Your medications
- Caregiver: Your dependents' information
- Doctor: Your patients' data

**Q: Will my medications disappear when I switch roles?**
A: No. Your Patient medications are always saved. Switching roles just changes which dashboard you see.

**Q: Can I switch roles mid-task?**
A: Yes, but unsaved changes will be lost. Save your work before switching.

**Q: Which role should I register as?**
A: Choose based on your primary use:
- Taking your own meds? → Patient
- Caring for someone else? → Caregiver (but you can still add yourself later)
- Healthcare provider? → Doctor

**Q: How do I know which role I'm currently using?**
A: Look for:
- Color of the interface (blue/orange/purple)
- "Active Role" text in sidebar (desktop)
- Role badge in burger menu (mobile)
- Page title in top bar

## Accessibility Features

- **Large Touch Targets**: All role cards are 56px+ tall for easy tapping
- **Color + Icons**: Not just color - each role has unique icon
- **Clear Labels**: "Patient", "Caregiver", "Healthcare Professional"
- **Haptic Feedback**: Phone vibrates when switching (if supported)
- **Confirmation Toast**: Shows success message after switch

## Privacy & Security

### Data Separation
- Each role's data is isolated
- Patient can't see Caregiver's dependents
- Caregiver can't access Patient's personal meds
- Doctor's patient list is completely separate

### Shared Access (Coming Soon)
- Caregivers can request access to Patient's medications
- Patients can grant permission to specific caregivers
- Doctors can be invited by patients for oversight

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with one role, add others as needed
2. **Consistent Switching**: Use the same method each time (sidebar or burger menu)
3. **Check Your Role**: Before adding data, confirm you're in the right role
4. **Use Color Cues**: Train yourself to recognize blue/orange/purple
5. **Save Before Switching**: Complete your current task first
